## Python CRUD Application for Inventory Management

A comprehensive Python application for managing inventory data with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

## Business Understanding

This project caters to businesses in various sectors (e.g., retail, manufacturing) by providing a streamlined solution for managing product inventory. Efficient inventory management ensures product availability, minimizes stockouts and overstocking, and optimizes ordering processes.

**Benefits:**

* Improved stock accuracy: Real-time inventory data reduces discrepancies and ensures informed decision-making.
* Enhanced order fulfillment: Accurate stock levels enable efficient order fulfillment and customer satisfaction.
* Reduced carrying costs: Optimized inventory management minimizes storage costs and prevents overstocking.
* Improved demand forecasting: Data-driven insights support better forecasting of future demand.

**Target Users:**

This application is designed for inventory managers, warehouse staff, and sales representatives within a business to manage product stock levels, track sales, and maintain accurate inventory data.

## Features

* **Create:**
    * Add new product entries to the inventory system, specifying details like product name, description, SKU (Stock Keeping Unit), quantity on hand, reorder point, and category.
    * Implement validation rules to ensure data accuracy (e.g., unique SKU, positive quantity).
* **Read:**
    * Search and retrieve specific product information by name, SKU, or category.
    * Display comprehensive product details in a user-friendly format, including stock availability, product image (optional), and reorder point.
    * Integrate pagination for large product lists.
* **Update:**
    * Modify existing product information to reflect changes in stock levels, pricing, or product details.
    * Provide clear confirmation or error messages for update success or failure.
* **Delete:**
    * Allow for the removal of discontinued or obsolete products with appropriate authorization checks.
    * Consider offering a soft delete functionality to prevent permanent data loss (optional).
* **Reporting:**
    * Generate reports on inventory levels, low-stock items, and sales trends to support informed inventory management and purchasing decisions.
    * Export reports in various formats (e.g., CSV, Excel) for further analysis.

## Installation

## Data Model

This project utilizes a relational database (PostgreSQL) to store product information. The following tables are used:

* **Products:**
    * `id` (Integer, Primary Key): Unique identifier for each product.
    * `name` (String): Name of the product.
    * `description` (Text): Detailed product description (optional).
    * `sku` (String, Unique): Stock Keeping Unit for the product.
    * `quantity` (Integer): Current stock level of the product.
    * `reorder_point` (Integer): Minimum stock level before reordering.
    * `category` (String): Category of the product (e.g., electronics, clothing).
    * `image_url` (String, optional): URL for the product image.
